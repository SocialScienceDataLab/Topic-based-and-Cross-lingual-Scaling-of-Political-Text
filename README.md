## Abstract
Political text scaling aims to linearly order parties and politicians across political dimensions (e.g., left-to-right ideology) based on textual content (e.g., politician speeches or party manifestos). Existing models, such as Wordscores and Wordfish, scale texts based on relative word usage; by doing so, they do not take into consideration topical information and cannot be used for cross-lingual analyses. In our talk, we present our efforts toward developing a topic-based and cross-lingual political text scaling approach.
First we introduce our initial work, TopFish, a multiÂ­level computational method that integrates topic detection and political scaling and shows its applicability for temporal aspect analyses of political campaigns (pre-primary elections, primary elections, and general elections). Next, we present a new text scaling approach that leverages semantic representations of text and is suitable for cross-lingual political text scaling.  We also propose a simple and straightforward setting for quantitative evaluation of political text scaling
